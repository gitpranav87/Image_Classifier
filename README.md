# Image Classifier Project

This repository hosts an Image Classifier project created using machine learning techniques. The project aims to classify images into different categories or labels using advanced machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

The Image Classifier project encompasses the following key components:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering a diverse and representative dataset containing images relevant to the classification task.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the collected dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for training the classifier.

3. **Model Development:** Designing and training the image classifier using machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other suitable models.

4. **Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using validation and test datasets to measure its accuracy and generalization capability.

5. **Deployment:** Deploying the trained model and creating a user-friendly interface (web or application) for users to interact with the classifier.

## Features
